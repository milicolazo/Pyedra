**Pyedra** is a python library that allows you to fit three different models of asteroid phase functions to your observations.

Motivation
----------

Phase curves of asteroids are very important for the scientific community as they can provide information needed for diameter and albedo estimates. Given the large amount of surveys currently being carried out and planned for the next few years, we believe it is necessary to have a tool capable of processing and providing useful information for such an amount of observational data.
