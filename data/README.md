# Datasets
Here is a description of the data used in Pyedra's main module as well as in the tests.

--------------------------------------------------
## `penttila2016.csv`
For the adjustment of the phase function H-G1-G2 the tabulated values of the base functions presented in Penttila et. al (2016) were used.

> A. Penttil ̈a,  V. G. Shevchenko, O. Wilkman, & K. Muinonen (2016). H,G1, G2photometric phase function
> extended to low-accuracy data. 123:117–125.

--------------------------------------------------
##  `inputdata_carbognani2019.csv`
This dataset consists of the phase angles and V magnitudes observed by Carbognani et. al (2019). These data are used as input to perform the tests. 

##  `results_carbognani2019.csv`
This dataset contains the results obtained by Carbognani et. al 2019. It is used in the tests to compare if the data obtained with Pyedra agrees with those obtained by the authors.

> Carbognani, A., Cellino, A., & Caminiti, S. (2019). New phase-magnitude curves for some main belt asteroids, 
> fit of different photometric systems and calibration of the albedo-Photometry relation. 
> Planetary and Space Science, 169, 15-34.
